# FFBEUnitEquiper
This began as a bad unit calculator I made for an intro App design class.
I plan to recode it with an object oriented approach in mind.
My goal is to take what I learned and create something I can share with the FFBE community, and learn some new things during the process.
It will be integrated with a database after it is cleaned up and kept up to date when new content is released (roughly weekly).

Included are the main Java files, and the resources such as xml layouts, the manifest, and images, and the databases. Many of these will change or dissappear alltogether during the recoding.
