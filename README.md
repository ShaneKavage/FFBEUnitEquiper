# FFBEUnitEquiper
This began as a bad unit calculator I made for an intro App design class.
Ive been recoding with better practices than when I firist started.
My goal is to take what I learned and create something I can share with the FFBE community, and learn some new things during the process.

Included are the main Java files, and the resources such as xml layouts, the manifest, and images, and the databases. Many of these will change or dissappear alltogether during the recoding.
