# FFBEUnitEquiper

This began as a bad unit calculator I made for the intro class.
I plan to recode it with an object oriented approach in mind.
My goal is to take what I learned and create something I can share with the FFBE community, and learn some new things during the process.
It will be integrated with a database after it is cleaned up and kept up to date when new content is released (roughly weekly).

I cant include the whole project due to file limitations, so included are the main Java files, and the resources such as
xml layouts, the manifest, and images. Many of these will change or dissappear alltogether during the recoding.
